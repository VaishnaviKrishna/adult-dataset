# Prediction of annual income using adult dataset
* The aim of this project is to be able to analyze the adult dataset and classify the annual income of an individual to either <50K or >50K category (binary classification). Various classfiers have been implemented and their performance have been compared to arrive at the best model for this particular dataset.
* Data obtained from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
* Since the adult dataset has huge amount of data that I could not handle in my computer, I have performed the data analysis and classifier implementation using 1/3rd of the data obtained through random sampling.

# Software
* The analysis and implementation has been done using Python 3.6 version. The versions of the external libraries used are as mentioned below:
